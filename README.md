# ML Apprentice Take-Home Project

## Overview

This project implements a sentence transformer model with multi-task learning capabilities using PyTorch and Hugging Face Transformers.

## Tasks

1. **Sentence Transformer Implementation**: Encodes input sentences into fixed-length embeddings.
2. **Multi-Task Learning Expansion**: Adds classification and sentiment analysis heads to the model.
3. **Training Considerations**: Discusses strategies for freezing layers and transfer learning.
4. **Training Loop Implementation**: Demonstrates a training loop for the multi-task model.

## Setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/giripranay/ml_apprentice_takehome.git
cd multitask_sentence_transformer
pip install -r requirements.txt
